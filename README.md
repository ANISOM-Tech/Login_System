# Login_System
Login System is a python programming based project. Here you have the main login frame with two others. One of them is for forgot password, and another one is for new registration. In new registration, you have to fill all the fields, and after successfully processing the details, it will generate a unique username and a unique password.
All user details, along with username and password, are stored in a CSV file, which works as the database.
This project is just a prototype. You can easily upgrade this project without any problem.
Thank you.
